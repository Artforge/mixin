Mixin.Backbone.Events Docs
********************

This mixin provides a way to mixin Backbone.Events to any instance. Also, it provides a way to mark the native classes as having the Backbone.Events mixin (autoMarkNative).


TODO! for now, please study the tests in: test/mixin_subscriptions/mixin_subscriptions_tests.coffee

API
******
1) autoMarkNative - marks the native Backbone.Model, Backbone.Collection, Backbone.View and Backbone.Router through an initialize function as having the 'Backbone.Events' mixin.
-> Useful if you query objects at runtime for Backbone.Events or if you use the Mixin.UNMIX_ON_BACKBONE_DESTROY option (see Mixin.Core).
