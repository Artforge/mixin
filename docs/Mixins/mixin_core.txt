Mixin.Core Docs
********************

This provides core mixin management functions like Mixin.in, Mixin.out, and Mixin.hasMixin.

TODO! for now, please study the tests in: test/mixin_core/mixin_core_tests.coffee

API
******
1) registerMixin - use this to register the mixin name, an object to mixin, and initialize/destroy functions.
  -> mixin_info object:
      mixin_name: string (required)
      mixin_object: object with properties to mixin (required)
      initialize: function called on each instance when Mixin.in is called (optional)
      destroy: function called on each instance when Mixin.out is called (optional)
  -> Note: initialize and destroy functions are called with the mixin bound to 'this'.

Options
*******
1) Mixin.UNMIX_ON_BACKBONE_DESTROY - this is a global setting which, when enabled, automatically unmixes all mixins when an instance receives a Backbone.Event destroy event "instance.trigger('destroy')". Best used in conjuction with Mixin.AutoMemory.
